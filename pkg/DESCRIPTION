Description: A shinyapp-based GUI wrapper for ggplot with built-in statistical analysis. Import data from file and use dropdown menus and checkboxes to specify the plotting variables, graph type, and look of your plots. Once created, plots can be saved independently or stored in a report that can be saved as a pdf. If new data are added to the file, the report can be refreshed to include new data. Statistical tests can be chosen and can be added to the graphs.
